A basic shell implementation which emulates the core functionality of BASH.

To build:
    
    Compile the file smallsh.c into the desired executable.
    
    $gcc -std=gnu99 -o smallsh smallsh.c

    smallsh.c will include all other needed files
    
    * USE GNU99, gcc defaults may not compile *

To run:
    Run the executable named in the build step.

    $./smallsh

    Interact with the shell
